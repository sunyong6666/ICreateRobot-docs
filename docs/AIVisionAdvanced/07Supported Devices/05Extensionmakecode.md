###  Introduction
<!-- 这是一张图片，ocr 内容为： -->
![](img/MC01.png)

The AI Vision Module utilizes the high-performance K210 chip as the core processing unit and integrates a wide range of machine vision algorithms and functions. Users can flexibly invoke multiple built-in AI capabilities through the physical dial on the top of the module, including color capture, color block tracking, Apriltag label recognition, line detection, recognition of 20 common object types, QR code recognition, face detection and recognition, deep learning inference, traffic sign recognition, and real-time Wi-Fi image transmission.

On the right side of the module, there is a Grove multifunctional interface, which supports communication protocols such as I²C or UART through a graphical configuration interface, making it easier to connect with various external sensors and actuators. This significantly enhances the system's expandability and usability. The module is compatible with the CANMV open-source framework, allowing users to train and deploy image models based on custom datasets, offering high flexibility and customization for visual applications in specific scenarios.

<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">It is recommended to use the micro:bit V2.0 or higher versions as the main control board. Lower versions have insufficient memory, which may cause issues with functionality.</font>

The extension file used for MakeCode is [AI Vision_micro:bit_V0.1.0.hex](https://github.com/ICreateRobot/AI-Vision-Sensor-). It is recommended to download it in advance.

### Function Introduction  
The **Vision Sensor** can be powered and operated through its two interfaces (HY2.0-4P / Type-C). The **micro:bit** can use the **HY2.0-4P interface** for both power supply and communication with the vision module.

Each AI function of the vision module corresponds to an independent interface (excluding the settings interface). Users can directly operate the module using the dial button on the module, without relying on port control.

By toggling the dial button left or right, you can switch between different function interfaces. Once a specific interface is entered, the corresponding AI function will be automatically enabled. Some functions also support more detailed control through the button (the specific operation depends on the current function). Please refer to the descriptions in the **AI Functions** section.

_The images shown below are for reference only; the actual display may vary depending on the sensor's interface._

#### Top Status Bar and Bottom Navigation Bar  
<!-- 这是一张图片，ocr 内容为： -->
![](img/MC02.png)

To optimize the interface display, the top and bottom status bars will automatically hide after 5 seconds of inactivity.  

+ **Re-display the Status Bar**:    
Any interaction with the dial button (e.g., click or rotate) will wake up and display the status bar.  
    - **Note**: This action only wakes up the interface and does not trigger any function switch or setting change.  
+ **Restore Operation**:    
 Once the status bar is displayed, you can normally use the buttons for function control.  
**Design Purpose**: To keep the interface clean while avoiding accidental touches that might interfere with the current task.  

**Interface Layout Description:  **

1. **Bottom Navigation Bar  **
    - **Center Highlighted Icon**: Indicates the currently active function.
    - **Left and Right Icons**: Represent the "previous" and "next" functions that can be switched (via rotating the dial left or right).
2. **Top Status Area  **
    - The displayed content dynamically changes with the current function.
    - Specific information will depend on the actual function being used.

> **Interaction Logic**:  
When the dial button is rotated left or right, the **highlighted icon** in the bottom navigation bar will switch accordingly, and the top content will update to display the exclusive information of the target function.  
>

#### Settings Interface  
<!-- 这是一张图片，ocr 内容为： -->
![](img/MC03.png)

+  The **Settings Interface** is used to configure the module's basic parameters, such as language, port protocol, and more. When you first enter this interface, you need to press the button to activate the settings function.
+ By default, the language setting option is selected (highlighted), and you can switch to other settings (such as port protocol) by rotating the button left or right.
+ After making the necessary changes, you need to click the **Exit** button to save the settings. Some settings require a reboot to take effect, and the device will automatically restart.  

#####  Language Settings
When this option is selected, press the button to toggle between **Chinese** and **English**.  

##### Port Protocol
The protocol for communication with the K210 is influenced by the Control Chip option. Refer to the Communication Protocol section for more details. You can set the protocol by pressing the button.

**K210 Mode**

+ **IIC Protocol**
+ **UART Protocol**
+ **SPIKE Compatibility Mode**

**ESP32 Mode**

+ **IIC Protocol**

When set to the **SPIKE Protocol**, the device must be connected to a SPIKE device via an adapter board; otherwise, the visual module will not function. For additional details, refer to the **SPIKE Compatibility Mode** section under the **Communication Protocol** chapter.  

##### Address Selection  
The selected address is the **IIC address** for the K210. The available options are **0x24**, **0x25**, and **0x26**. Use the button to set the address.  

##### Fill Light  
This option is used to configure the fill light at the back of the module. When the fill light option is selected, the menu expands to include the fill light switch, brightness settings, and the return option. Select the option and press the button to adjust the fill light parameters. A rectangular box will appear to choose one of the options. You can rotate the button left or right to select an option, then press the button again to change the parameter.  

+ **Fill Light Status**:  
There are two states: **On** and **Off**. The fill light will only be turned on when set to "On"; otherwise, it remains off.  
+ **Fill Light Brightness**:  
This setting adjusts the brightness of the fill light, with a range from **0% to 100%** in 10% increments. Finer adjustments are not possible.
+ **Return**:  
Exit the fill light settings.

**Screen Brightness**  
This option adjusts the screen brightness, with a range from **20% to 100%** in 20% increments. Finer adjustments are not available.  

##### **Exit**
Exit the settings and save the changes. 

After making changes in the settings interface, you must click **Exit** to save the settings. The specific rules are as follows:  

1. **General Settings** (e.g., language, etc.)
    - Changes are saved directly after modification, and no reboot is required.
2. **Key Parameters **(e.g., control chip, port protocol, address selection)
    - If the values differ from those when initially entering the settings interface,
    - Clicking **Exit** will automatically reboot the module to apply the new configuration.

> **Note**: If you do not click **Exit** and directly power off the device, the settings will be lost!  
>

##### Flashing  
 The **Type-C interface** on the side of the module supports both firmware flashing and power supply functions.  [Flashing](https://ai-vision-advanced-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/AIVisionAdvanced/06FirmwareFlashing.html)

|  Connection Diagram for Six-Channel Color and Grayscale Sensors   | | |


This diagram shows how to connect the six-channel color and grayscale sensors to the K210 AI Vision Module. 

### <font style="color:rgb(38, 38, 38);">Coding Programming  </font>
<font style="color:rgb(38, 38, 38);"></font>The **K210 AI Vision Module** starts up when the **micro:bit** is powered on and enters the default color recognition mode after booting. When programming, it is recommended not to switch the module's mode immediately after powering on, as the module requires about 5 seconds for initialization.

<font style="color:rgb(38, 38, 38);">Instead, it is recommended to use triggers such as buttons (as shown in the diagram below) to switch the module’s AI recognition mode after the initialization period.</font>

<font style="color:rgb(38, 38, 38);">  </font>
