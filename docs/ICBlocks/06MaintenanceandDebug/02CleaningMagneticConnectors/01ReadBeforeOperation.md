# Read Before Operation!
During the use of ICBlocks series blocks, some users have encountered uncertainty about which specific areas of the magnetic connectors to clean. This often leads to excessive effort without achieving the desired results. To prevent such issues, carefully read this chapter before starting the cleaning process to ensure proper execution.  

## Introduction to Magnetic Connectors  
All electronic blocks in the ICBlocks series communicate through magnetic contact points. Due to the design of the magnetic socket structure and environmental factors, dirt may accumulate on the magnetic connectors of electronic blocks, causing errors in signal transmission. To reduce such problems, it is recommended that users regularly clean the probes and contact points of ICBlocks blocks.

| **Recommended:** Use a dedicated hard-bristle circuit cleaning brush.   |  Soft-bristle toothbrushes are too gentle and may not effectively clean.   |




**Selection Criteria:** Dirt on magnetic probes is often stubborn. A soft-bristle toothbrush may fail to remove it, so a hard-bristle brush is recommended for higher efficiency.
