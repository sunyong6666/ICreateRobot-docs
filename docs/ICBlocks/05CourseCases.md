#Course Cases
## Introduction
Based on years of educational practice and an in-depth understanding of the learning characteristics of children aged 3-6, we have carefully compiled this teacher's book for home and school. Based on the ICBlocks series, this book guides the readers to learn the programming method and related knowledge of ICblocks through 16 well-designed cases. Each case centers on a specific theme, and the content is step-by-step, aiming to stimulate children's creativity and logical thinking ability and help them learn the basics of programming in an enjoyable process of exploration.
