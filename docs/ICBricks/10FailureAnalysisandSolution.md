# Failure Analysis and Solution
## Unable to Detect Bluetooth in the Programming Software  
**Scenario 1: Programming Software Settings Issue  **

Ensure the following settings are enabled: location services, Bluetooth services, and location permissions.  

**Scenario 2: ICBricks Hub Issue  **

If all required settings are enabled but Bluetooth still cannot be detected, try the following:

+ **Firmware Issue**: Update the firmware to resolve the issue.
+ **Hardware Issue**: If updating the firmware does not help, the ICBricks hub may have a hardware fault. Please contact your sales representative for after-sales repair assistance.



## **ICBricks Hub** Won't Turn On  
**Scenario 1: Low Battery  **

 Check if the bricks hub is unable to turn on due to low battery.  Charge the bricks hub until the indicator light turns green, then disconnect the charger and try turning it on again.  

**Scenario 2: Firmware Issue  **

If the bricks hub has power but won’t turn on, it may have a firmware issue. Try updating the firmware.  

**Scenario 3: Battery Performance Decline  **

If the battery cannot fully charge or hold a charge, replace the battery and test again. If the issue persists after replacing the battery, contact your sales representative for after-sales assistance.  

**Scenario 4: Hardware Issue  **

If none of the above resolves the issue, the hardware circuitry may be faulty. Please contact your sales representative for repair assistance.  

## ICBricks Hub Buttons Not Controlling Actuators  
**Scenario 1: Incorrect Port Connection  **

In direct control mode, ensure the actuator is connected to the correct ICBricks hub port.  

**Scenario 2: Bluetooth Connection or Program Execution  **

 If the hub is connected via Bluetooth or running a program, button controls will be disabled, as these actions take priority over direct control mode. Disconnect Bluetooth or stop the program and try again.  

**Scenario 3: Logical Restriction Mode  **

If the hub does not emit a prompt sound when any function button is pressed, it may have entered logical restriction mode.  

**Scenario 4: Actuator Status Issue  **

Check if the actuator is functioning correctly:

+ Test the actuator with a different ICBricks hub.
+ Test the ICBricks hub with a different actuator.  
Compare results to identify the faulty component.

**Scenario 5: Hardware Issue  **

If the problem persists and hardware faults are confirmed, contact your sales representative for after-sales assistance.  

## Delayed Response of the Start Button in Advanced Programming  
The default function of the start button is to download the program to the ICBricks hub before execution. Due to the large data size during the download, packet loss may occur. The system will resend data within 4 seconds if packet loss is detected. Simply wait for the download to complete.

If the program does not start after a prolonged wait, reconnect the ICBricks hub or restart the device to troubleshoot.

## Motor Not Working Properly in Projects  
**Scenario 1: Connection or Port Issue**

+ Port Check: Reinsert the connector to ensure there is no loose contact.
+ Cable Check: Gently move the cable while connected to check for intermittent motor operation or connection sounds.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Port Connection  **

In programming mode, verify that the external device is connected to the port defined in the program to ensure logical consistency.  

**Scenario 3: Motor Fault  **

Test the motor on a different main controller port or connect a working motor to the current controller to identify the fault. If the motor is confirmed to be faulty, contact your sales representative for repair assistance.  

## Gesture Recognition Sensor Not Controlling/Freezing  
If connecting the gesture recognition sensor causes the device to freeze or fail to respond, it may be due to obstruction. The sensor relies on detecting light signal changes for operation. When blocked, it may continuously trigger interrupt signals. If these signals are not processed promptly, the system may enter an abnormal state, causing the sensor to stop responding or the device to lag.

To prevent this, ensure the sensor’s environment is unobstructed and avoid prolonged coverage by hands, clothing, or other objects.
