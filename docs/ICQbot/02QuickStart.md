# **QuickStart**

If you are using this product for the first time, please read this chapter carefully to quickly learn how to use ICQbot to make some simple cases. If you have already used this product, you can quickly browse this section or skip to subsequent sections for more detailed help.

Here are two curated cases to help you quickly get started with ICQbot and experience its unique charm!  

## Voice Programming Control  
In this section, we will use the ICQbot Xiao Q Robot, voice recognition sensor, and motor to create a fan controlled by voice commands. Through this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of how voice commands interact with hardware modules.

| c、 Start using the fan:  <br/>+ First, wake up ICQbot by saying "Hello, Xiao Q."<br/>+ Use voice commands like “Motor one forward/reverse” to control the fan's rotation.<br/>+ Say “Stop motion” to stop the motor. | |




## Software Programming Control  
In this section, we will guide you through creating a voice-controlled stage character. This project will help you understand how to use voice commands to manipulate stage characters effectively.
