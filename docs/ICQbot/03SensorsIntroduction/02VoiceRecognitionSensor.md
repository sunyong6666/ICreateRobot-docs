The ICQbot voice recognition sensor is capable of receiving voice commands, processing them through an internal chip, and outputting recognized instructions via serial communication. It can identify over 50 unique voice commands and provide corresponding reply phrases, helping users confirm successful recognition. The ICQbot Xiao Q Robot can use these voice commands to control actuators or software characters, enabling various fun applications.
