# Extension-ICBricks 2.0

## Quick Start
In the ICBricks software, the Vision Module Extension must be used together with the K210 Vision Module.

During use, up to 11 AI functions can be called, including color recognition, color block tracking, tag recognition, and 20-class object recognition.

For more details, please refer to the K210 Vision Module Documentation.



**Example: Use Tag Recognition to Control Motor Start/Stop**
